# Combinatorial discrepancy algorithms

Experimental implementation of the Lovett-Meka combinatorial discrepancy algorithm (see the [original paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/130929400) for reference) and its derandomization by Levy, Ramadas and Rothvoss (see the [original paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59250-3_31) for reference).

The implementation is experimental and not documented at this stage. Feel free to reach out for explanations.
